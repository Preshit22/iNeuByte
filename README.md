## Iris Flower Classification

### Overview

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It uses various machine learning models for classification, including Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is available in scikit-learn.

### Usage

1. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the `iris_classification.ipynb` script to train and evaluate the models.

### Results

The script will output the accuracy and other relevant metrics for each model.

## CIFAR-10 Dataset with Convolutional Neural Network

### Overview

This project utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The goal is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify these images into their respective categories.

### Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is available from the Keras library.

### Usage

1. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the `cifar10_cnn.ipynb` script to train and evaluate the CNN model.

### Results

The script will display training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs. Additionally, it will provide test accuracy and generate confusion matrices.

## IMDB Movie Review Classification using Naive Bayes

### Overview

This project involves sentiment analysis of movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB). It uses the Naive Bayes classification algorithm to classify reviews as positive or negative based on their text content.

### Dataset

The IMDB Movie Review dataset is available from the NLTK library.

### Usage

1. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the `imdb_movie_review_classification.ipynb` script to preprocess the data, train the Naive Bayes model, and evaluate its performance.

### Results

The script will output classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for the Naive Bayes model.
